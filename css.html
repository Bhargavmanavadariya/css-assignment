                                    - Page reformatting<br>
                                    - Site-wide consistency<br>
                                    - Bandwidth<br>

                                    The disadvantages of using CSS are:

                                    - Target-specific texts, styling, and rules are not allowed
                                    - There are no expressions
                                    - There is no dynamic behavior to control pseudo-class
                                    - It is not possible to ascend by selectors
                                    - Vertical control is limited
                                    - No column declaration.

                                    - In CSS2, everything is present in a single document while CSS3 is categorized into
                                    multiple sections called modules.
                                    - Graphics-related features such as Box-shadow or Border-radius, flexbox, etc. can
                                    be found - which are absent in case of CSS2.
                                    - Properties such as background-position, background-image, and background-repeat
                                    styles - can be helpful for using multiple background images in a single webpage.
                                    - CSS3 versions support many new browsers.
                                    - CSS3 introduces many new selectors in the form of pseudo-elements and
                                    pseudo-classes.

                                    The background color of an image can be changed using the background-color property.

                                    Example:
                                    body

                                    To control the repetition of an image in the background, use the background-repeat
                                    property. You can use no-repeat value for the background-repeat property if you do
                                    not want to repeat an image, in this case, the image will display only once.

                                    The background-position CSS property sets the initial position for each background
                                    image.
                                    The default position is the top left of the page. The positions that can be set
                                    include top, bottom, left, right, and center.
                                    Example:

                                    The background-attachment CSS property sets whether a background image's position is
                                    fixed within the viewport, or scrolls with its containing block.
                                    Example:
                                    background-attachment: scroll;
                                    background-attachment: fixed;

                                    It enhances the legibility of style sheets. The background property is a complex
                                    property in CSS, and if it is combined with color, the complexity will further
                                    increase.
                                    Color is an in-built property while the background is not one. And this can lead to
                                    a lot of confusion.

                                    been discussed and officially ratified by W3C members, it becomes a recommendation.
                                    World Wide Web (W3C) maintains the CSS specifications.

                                    to access the stylesheet.
                                    The link to an external style sheet is placed within the head section of the page.

                                    Multiple documents with various styles can be controlled using different styles.
                                    Selector and grouping methods can be used for grouping styles in composite
                                    situations.

                                    Disadvantages:

                                    For rendering the document, external style sheets have to be loaded.
                                    It is not suitable for small style definitions.
                                    For importing documents with style information, an additional download is required.

                                    CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.
                                    In CSS, selectors are used to target the HTML elements on our web pages that we want
                                    to style.
                                    Example:
                                    h1 { color: blue; }

                                    Rulesets can be used to identify selectors attached to one another. It consists of
                                    two different parts - selector and declaration.
                                    A CSS rule set contains one or more selectors and one or more declarations. The
                                    selector(s), which in this example is h1, points to an HTML element. The
                                    declaration(s), which in this example are color: blue and text-align: center style
                                    the element with a property and value. The rule set is the main building block of a
                                    CSS sheet.

                                    h1 {
                                    color: blue;
                                    text-align: center;
                                    }

                                </p>
